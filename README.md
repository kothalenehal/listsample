# Flutter ListWidget Example

This Flutter example demonstrates a dynamic list of items, each with a counter that can be incremented.

## Usage

This Flutter app consists of two main components:

### ListWidget

This widget creates a scrollable list of items. Each item displays a count and an increment button. The `counts` map keeps track of individual counts for each item.

### ListItemWidget

This widget represents an item in the list. It displays the current count and an increment button. When the button is pressed, the count is updated and reflected in the list.
